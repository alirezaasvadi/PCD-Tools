# PCD-Tools
Tools for working with Point Cloud Data in Python.

A point in 3D Euclidean space can be defined as a position in x-, y- and z- coordinates. PCD is a set of such data points; and can be
used to represent a volumetric model of urban environments. In our case, PCD is captured by a 3D-LIDAR and contains an additional reflection information. LIDAR reflection measures the ratio of the received beam sent to a surface, which
depends upon the distance, material, and the angle between surface normal and the ray.
